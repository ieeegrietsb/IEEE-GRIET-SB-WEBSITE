        The objective is to understand the cause of such accidents and be mindful
  of the remedial measures to prevent them. As a part of the project, the role
  of fires in creating a hazardous impact on electrical accidents and simple
  detection and mitigation measures were discussed in brief. According to
  statistics, there were about 20000 incidents recorded which accounted for
  an enormous 20000 deaths a year. The dominant reasons for these deaths
  were identified to be gas cylinder accidents, poor design of electrical
  equipment, faulty cable wiring. The hazards of fire propagation were
  explained to students with relevant pictures. The talk ended with an
  interaction with the students and the faculty in the audience.

        Growing urbanizations has led to innumerable problems for
        commuters who are delayed on account of traffic jams. Metro Rail
        will allow them to bypass these traffic congestion barriers. The
        introduction session was held in a Stimulator room which was a
        replication of an actual train monitoring system, which helps in
        teaching and recruitment of train operators. Monitor in this room
        consists of different parameters. The display of speed, distance,
        every movement of the train was recorded. Different modes at
        which train can be operated, mechanism of door control,
        announcements were explained. Every train operator undergoes a
        breath analyser drive test to ensure the safety of passengers.. They
        ensure the best transport facility to people by using more
        communication-based train control, through which the exact
        location of the train can be known and other factors can be
        monitored. They even showed the mechanism behind train control
        in an emergency situation. The students have gained vast exposure
        to various management concept that they have learned in the
        classroom such as operations and risk management, leadership
        skills and traits, and very importantly the just in time technique.

      <p>
        IEEE GRIET student branch EXE-COM chapter conducted the talk
        session on 29th February 2020. This session was held in the CSE block.
        The main intention for this session is to elucidate about the world’s
        largest technical professional organization, IEEE. The session began with
        an introduction to its Mission and Vision.
        <br>
        Students showed great interest to learn about the captivating benefits of
        IEEE. CH. Akash Reddy, chairman of IEEE GRIET SB,Secretary
        Midhuna Garapati, chairman advisor D.S.R.N.V.Krishna Sai m ade the
        session more interactive by sharing his overall experiences in the past few
        years. He even conveyed about the significant principles, involved in
        growing the networks and leadership skills.
        <br>
        All students were segregated into different groups and each group was
        given a kit which is composed of different raw materials. Each team was
        asked to build a creative article out of them or construct a working model
        based upon their kits and was even asked to name their project suitably.
        All students were engaged in it completely. Students engaged themselves
        into their respective group activities.Each and everyone showcased their
        creative corner and came up with new interesting ideas. It turned out
        interactive with everyone’s participation.

      <p>
        IEEE Computer Society in association with the free
        software wing of GRIET conducted a technical talk on
        “ Data and Consent ”. The talk was conducted on 19th
        February 2020 from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The session
        was very informative as the audience were educated about
