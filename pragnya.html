          <p>
            Pragnya, over the years has served as a thriving platform for the expression of
            science, technology and managerial ventures with sheer brilliance and creativity from

            An activity tracker is a device or application for monitoring and tracking
            fitnes s -related metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in
            some cases heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer. With the goal of
            understanding the functioning, the students were provided with kits which consisted
            of various components like heartbeat sensor, bluetooth module, temperature sensor
            etc to build their own fitness band and connecting it to their mobiles. The students
            found the workshop very interesting as it helped them perceive the subject beyond
            the confined walls of a classroom.
